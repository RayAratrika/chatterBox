A web based chat app made using NodeJS, socket.io (chat replay api).
User has to provide his/her nickname and the name of the room he/she creates.
All users in the same room will be notified when someone enters/leaves/is typing.
This web app was primarily built for my university's mental health cub in cse someone wanted to speak to a counsellor but wanted to keep their identity to themselves. 
Has no css added, just a basic layout of how the app would work. Still working on it...
