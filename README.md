A web based chat app made using NodeJS, socket.io .
User has to provide his/her nickname and the name of the room he/she creates.
Open the localhost url on two tabs and see the working of it back and forth.
All users in the same room will be notified when someone enters/leaves/is typing.

Has no css added, just a basic layout of how the app would work. Still working on it...
